## 1. Project Brief

With the vast array of content on YouTube, understanding personal viewing habits can provide insightful revelations about interests and preferences. This project aims to conduct a personal analysis of the type of content consumed on YouTube, leveraging the capabilities of  YouTube API v3 and Python for data extraction and analysis.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python

- **API:** YouTube Data API v3

- **Libraries:** `Pandas` for data manipulation, `Matplotlib/Seaborn` for visualisation, `Requests` for API interaction

- **Dashboard Tool:** `Google Colab` Notebook or a web-based framework like Dash or `Streamlit` (v1.29.0, Release: Nov 30, 2023)


## 3. Objectives

1. **Data Collection:** Utilize YouTube API v3 to collect comprehensive data on videos watched, including titles, channels, categories, duration, and engagement metrics (likes, views, comments).
2. **Personal Viewing Profile:** Analyse the collected data to create a profile of personal YouTube consumption, identifying the most-watched categories, favourite channels, and prevalent themes.
3. **Trends and Patterns:** Investigate viewing patterns over time, such as preferred days for watching, average watch duration, and changes in content preferences.
4. **Interactive Dashboard:** Develop an interactive Python-based dashboard to visualise the analysis, allowing for dynamic filtering and exploration of the data.
5. **Insights and Recommendations:** Generate insights on personal content preferences and suggest potential new areas or channels of interest based on consumption patterns.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- A comprehensive understanding of personal YouTube content consumption patterns.

- Identification of potential new content areas based on existing preferences.

- Enhanced Python and data analysis skills through practical application.


## 4. Methodology
- **API Setup and Authentication**: Register the project in Google Cloud Console, enable YouTube Data API v3, and set up OAuth 2.0 credentials.
- **Data Extraction**: Write Python scripts using the Requests library to query the API and retrieve data on personal YouTube activity.
- **Data Processing**: Use Pandas for cleaning, transforming, and structuring the data into a suitable format for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform statistical and exploratory analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the viewing data.
- **Visualisation**: Create graphs, charts, and interactive elements to visually represent the findings.
- **Dashboard Development**: Assemble the visualizations into an interactive dashboard for easy exploration and analysis.
- **Insights Generation**: Interpret the data to offer insights into personal viewing habits and suggest new content areas.


## 5. Post (WhatsApp, LinkedIn)

**Project Selection Criteria**

- Take any area of your life you're "interested" in understanding more
- Get the data: personal, open source, fake (kaggle) or commercial
- Align the project to your area of work (consultancy/business/9-5)
- Write a project document (use a format relevant to your industry)
- Publish on platforms you intend to build your client base (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)

With more projects, you build a professional competence portfolio and proof of your skills/achievements; it's one thing to claim on your CV that you know something, and it's another to have a way to substantiate it.
